# Project-3 for OpenClassrooms.com

### Mini-maze-game that is made with Pygame and extensive use of OOP.

The player incarnates the famous Mc Gyver. In order to escape his prison, he needs to gather ether, a needle and plastic pipe to create a blowgun.



## Getting Started

* Download all files and place them in a single folder. 
* Use the "requirements.txt" or simply install Pygame v1.9.6

```
python -m pip install Pygame==1.9.6
```


## How to use

* The level is defined in the "config.txt" file, modify characters at will to change in game visuals.
* The items spawn randomly. This can be changed in the Items class if desired.
* The player can move with arrow or ZQSD keys.
* If the map or other elements were to change, don't forget to instanciate the classes.


## To do

* Write more explicit docstrings
* Experiment with collision detection
* Resize window
* Implement music and sound effects
* Finish writing maze-generation program 
* Write better code (shocking right ?)
